📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard I built to analyze the Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme. My aim was to take raw beneficiary data and turn it into insights that actually make sense—insights that could support better decisions and help understand how the scheme is performing across the country.
The dashboard highlights beneficiary trends, demographic patterns, Aadhaar/mobile registration coverage, and differences in performance across states.

Compare state-level performance to spot high and low-performing regions

Check Aadhaar and mobile number registration completeness

📊 Key KPIs
